- Options can be specified in the form --option value or --option=value.
- The order of precedence for option specification is: option specification, environment variable specification, and default value.
- If you specify a DBHOST other than localhost and the DB to be used has not been created, you need to specify DB_ROOTPASS correctly.
- If a DBHOST other than localhost is specified and the DB to be used is created, DBNAME/DBUSER/DBPASS must be specified correctly.

### Target Directory

If the provision succeeds, the following files and directories will be created in the target directory.

| File and directory name | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| .kusanagi.\*            | Describes the environment variables to be used by docker-compose |
| docker-compose.yml      | docker-compose configuration file                            |
| contents                | Copy of the content directory created on Docker              |
| .git                    | A directory for Git                                          |

After the revision is finished, copy the files on Docker generated by the revision under the contents directory, and they will be Git-registered and manageable.



### Docker container to be created

After provisioning, the following Docker container will be launched.

| Name    | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| httpd   | The httpd container performs web services by port-forwarding HTTP/TLS ports from the host's network through the httpd bridge. httpd runs in the application directory in the kusanagi volume as the root directory as the root directory. |
| php     | It runs PHP-FPM and communicates with the httpd container by sharing the httpd network. The application is placed on the kusanagi volume, and the DB is connected to using a socket file on the DB volume. <br />The php container is equipped with the ssmtp command, which enables SMTP forwarding to external servers. |
| db      | MySQL or Postgresql can be used. It is not created when using an external DB server. db uses a DB volume to place DB tables, etc., and communicates with php via a socket file. |
| config  | It is usually stopped, but it is started when kusanagi-docker config is used. <br />The kusanagi-docker config command manipulates the kusanagi and db volumes for application deployment, backup and restore. <br />When building WordPress, wpcli images are used to install and uninstall WorPress plugins, themes, languages, etc. |
| ftp     | Runs only when provisioned by WordPress. ftp communication from the php container to update WordPress core, plugins, and themes via the WordPress web page. |
| certbot | Obtain an SSL certificate from let's encrypt (we are currently experimenting with this and have not released instructions for use). |



![KUSANAGI RoD Image](RoD.png)



The docker-compose.yml file created after running provision contains only the minimum description.
If you want to change the logging method, use shared storage, swarm, etc., please modify docker-compose.yml to handle it. Also, docker-compose can be used to perform operations such as start/stop/ps/run/exec.

| dbdump [file]    | Output DB dump information to a data file on the target directory (dbdump when not specified). |
| dbrestore [file] | Restore the data file on the target directory (or dbdump when not specified) to the DB. |
| backup           | Perform pull and dbdump at the same time.                    |
| restore          | Perform push and dbrestore at the same time.                 |

Running pull and dbdump will not automatically commit to Git. Please use the git command to manage them as appropriate.



## wp

Available only when using WordPress. wpcli commands can be specified to operate on WordPress.

This command must be running on the target directory.



## import/export

It works the same as kusanagi-docker config backup/restore.

This command needs to work on the target directory.



## start/stop/restart/status

start/stop/restart starts, stops, and restarts Docker containers in the RoD environment.
status can be used to check the status of Docker containers.
You can also specify a container name such as httpd/php/db/ftp to start/stop/restart a specific container.

This command needs to run on the target directory.

These commands are wrappers for the docker-compose command, so you can use docker-compose on the target directory.



## Docker images to be used

Images for KUSANAGI RoD are already available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com).
All images are based on alpine10, but this may change in the future.
To use the recommended version (the current latest version), please run $HOME/.kusanagi/update_version periodically.

## For use with docker-machine

KUSANAGI RoD can be used in conjunction with docker-machine.
Create a docker-machine as usual and execute ``eval $(docker-machine env hostname`` to perform kusanagi-docker provision.

You can also migrate an existing container to another docker-machine by following the steps below.

1. Execute `kusanagi-docker import` to import the current container information.

2. Stop the container with `kusanagi-docker stop`.

3. Execute `eval $(docker-machine env hostname`)

4. Execute `docker-compose up -d`

5. If the DB is on localhost, wait until the DB is initialized.
   The following command can be used to check if the initialization is finished.

   ```
   $ source .kusanagi.db
   $ docker-compose run --rm config  mysqladmin status -u$DBUSER -p"$DBPASS" 2>&1 > /dev/null && echo ok || echo ng
   ```

6. Execute `kusanagi-docker export` to export container information.
